## Number 2
**The FitnessGramâ„¢ Pacer Test** is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more *difficult* as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in <sup>30 seconds.</sup> Line up at the start. The running speed starts <sub>slowly</sub>, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. ***[ding]*** Remember to run in a *straight line*, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, *get* *ready*, **start**.
